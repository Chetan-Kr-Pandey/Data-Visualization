# Data-Visualization
Here, You can find data visualization programs of each and every plots available in matplotlib. 
I created these programs while i was doing certification on "data visualization with Python".
Throughout this all program you will get a overfew of line plot, area plot , bar plot, histogram, pie plot, scatter plot, seaborn and folium.

IMPORTANT : all these graphs were created with the help of dummy data i got while doing certification. 
I use python pandas to import and process the data to create accurate data visualizations.

In Github , I shared that dummy data(in csv form) as well as the program and json file(json file used in folium program).

NOTE: i suggest to use jupyter notebook to run my code because the code i'm sharing is of jupyter notebook.

HAAPY PROGRAMMING!!!
